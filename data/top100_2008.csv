you know it youre frozen  But something happened For the very first time with you My heart melted to the ground Found something true And everyones looking round Thinking Im going crazy  But I dont care what they say Im in love with you They try to pull me away But they dont know the truth My hearts crippled by the vein That I keep on closing You cut me open and I  Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love You cut me open  Trying hard not to hear But they talk so loud Their piercing sounds fill my ears Try to fill me with doubt Yet I know that their goal Is to keep me from falling  But nothings greater than the rush that comes with your embrace And in this world of loneliness I see your face Yet everyone around me Thinks that Im going crazy maybe maybe  But I dont care what they say Im in love with you They try to pull me away But they dont know the truth My hearts crippled by the vein That I keep on closing You cut me open and I  Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love You cut me open  And its draining all of me Oh they find it hard to believe Ill be wearing these scars For everyone to see  I dont care what they say Im in love with you They try to pull me away But they dont know the truth My hearts crippled by the vein That I keep on closing You cut me open and I  Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love You cut me open and I  Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love I keep bleeding I keep keep bleeding love Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love You cut me open and I Keep bleeding Keep keep bleeding love,2,PopAlicia Keys,No One,I

Seas would rise when I gave the word Now in the morning I sleep alone Sweep the streets I used to own  I used to roll the dice Feel the fear in my enemys eyes Listened as the crowd would sing Now the old king is dead Long live the king One minute I held the key Next the walls were closed on me And I discovered that my castles stand Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  I hear Jerusalem bells aringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I cant explain Once youd gone there was never Never an honest word And that was when I ruled the world  It was a wicked and wild wind Blew down the doors to let me in Shattered windows and the sound of drums People couldnt believe what Id become Revolutionaries wait For my head on a silver plate Just a puppet on a lonely string Oh who would ever want to be king  I hear Jerusalem bells aringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I cant explain I know St Peter wont call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world  Oh oh oh oh oh oh 5x  Hear Jerusalem bells aringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I cant explain I know St Peter wont call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world,13,RockKaty Perry,I Kissed A Girl,This was never the way I planned not my intention I got so brave drink in hand lost my discretion Its not what Im used to just wanna

Well your name aint on the guest list who brung you You the more famous person you come through And the sexy lady next to you you come too And then it hit me standing outside of Heaven Waiting for God

nearly miss the airliners Magnified times five unless its pointed at the rhymer Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze Now thats important to say Cause even with all that most of us dont want it to fade We want it to braid Meaning we want it to grow meaning we want it to stay Like the governor called and he told him to wait Unstrap him from the chair and put him back in his cage The audience aint fazed And they aint gonna clap and they aint gonna praise They want everything back that theyve paid Cause theyve been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim If you are what you say

like five whole days Me and security aint getting along And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone So just take me home where the mood is mellow And the roses are thrown MMs are yellow And the light bulbs around my mirror dont flicker Everybody gets a nice autograph picture One for you and one for your sister Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener Every songs her favorite song and mics dont feedback All the reviewers say You need to go and see that And everybody claps cause everybody is pleased And then they all take the stage and start performing for me Like

couldnt see it  Until I let go  Gave into love and watched all the bitterness burn  Now Im coming alive  Body and soul  And feelin my world start to turn   And Ill taste every moment  And live it out loud  I know this is the time  This is the time  To be more than a name  Or a face in the crowd  I know this is the time  This is the time of my life  Time of my life   Holding onto things that vanished  Into the air  Left me in pieces  But now Im rising from the ashes  Finding my wings  And all that I needed  Was there all along  Within my reach  As close as the beat of my heart   So Ill taste every moment  And live it out loud  I know this is the time  This is the time to be  More than a name  Or a face in the crowd  I know this is the time  This is the time of my life  Time of my life   And Im out on the edge of forever  Ready to run  Im keeping my feet on the ground  My arms open wide  My face to the sun   Ill taste every moment  And live it out loud  I know this is the time  This is the time to be  More than a name  Or a face in the crowd  I know this is the time  This is the time of my life  Time of my life  More than a name  Or a face in the crowd  This is the time

Northern Michigan  Splashing through the sand bar Talking by the campfire Its the simple things in life like when and where We didnt have no Internet But man I never will forget The way the moonlight shined upon her hair  And we were trying different things We were smoking funny things Making love out by the lake to our favorite song Sipping whiskey out the bottle Not thinking bout tomorrow Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long  Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long  Catching Walleye from the dock Watching the waves roll off the rocks Shell forever hold a spot inside my soul Wed blister in the sun We couldnt wait for night to come To hit that sand and play some rock and roll  While we were trying different things And we were smoking funny things Making love out by the lake to our favorite song Sipping whiskey out the bottle Not thinking bout tomorrow Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  Sweet Home Alabama Turn it up  Now nothing seems as strange As when the leaves began to change Or how we thought those days would never end Sometimes I hear that song And I start to sing along And think man Id love to see that girl again  Man Id like to see that girl again  And we were trying different things And we were smoking funny things Making love out by the lake to our favorite song Sipping whiskey out the bottle Not thinking bout tomorrow Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  We were trying different things And we were smoking funny things Making love out by the lake to our favorite song Sipping whiskey out
