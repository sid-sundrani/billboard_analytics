1,Ed Sheeran,Perfect,I found a love for me Darling just dive right in and follow my lead Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet Oh I never knew you were the someone waiting for me  Cause we were just kids when we fell in love Not knowing what it was I will not give you up this time But darling just kiss me slow Your heart is all I own And in your eyes youre holding mine  Baby Im dancing in the dark With you between my arms Barefoot on the grass Listening to our favourite song When you said you looked a mess I whispered underneath my breath But you heard it Darling you look perfect tonight  Well I found a woman stronger than anyone I know She shares my dreams I hope that someday Ill share her home I found a love to carry more than just my secrets To carry love to carry children of our own  We are still kids but were so in love Fighting against all odds I know well be alright this time Darling just hold my hand Be my girl Ill be your man I see my future in your eyes  Baby Im dancing in the dark With you between my arms Barefoot on the grass Listening to our favourite song When I saw you in that dress Looking so beautiful I dont deserve this Darling you look perfect tonight  Baby Im dancing in the dark With you between my arms Barefoot on the grass Listening to our favourite song I have faith in what I see Now I know I have met an angel in person And she looks perfect I dont deserve this You look perfect tonight,Pop,2
